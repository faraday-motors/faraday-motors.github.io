    <h3>Ad rates and markets</h3>
    <br />
    <p>The modelling effort helped us identify the best markets and demographics of our potential buyers; but that information by itself is not sufficient to make an effective marketing strategy. In addition to demographic models it is necessary to build a cost model to identify the markets that not only has good target audience but also are cheaper to advertise to. For instance, is it better to advertise in New York city, which could be very expensive and reach a wider audience or advertise in smaller and cheaper cities but still reach a very targetted audience?</p>
    <p>
      In order to help this decision making, we used the regional advertisment rates from the two leading outdoor display ad providers, Clear Channel Outdoor and Lamar. The assumption made here is that the cost of display advertisment is a proxy to the regional cost of advertisment across other marketing channels.
