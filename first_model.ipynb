    "Interpretation of the Linear Regression model: Number of charging stations in each region is positively correlated to the population, percentage of male population, age, percentage of the population which is college educated, and income and negatively correlated to the percentage of home owners. The model predicts two charging stations for each 100,000 increase in population, ~0.08 charging stations for 10% increase in male percentage, ~0.07 charging stations for every 10 years increase in median age, ~0.1 charging station for every 10% increase in % of college educated, and ~0.14 charging stations for every $10,000 increase in median income; and -0.17 charging stations for every 10 percentage increase in home ownership.  As an example, the simple linear model predicts 1.5 charging stations for Coppell, Texas (vs. 3 actual charging stations). The underestimate is due to the combination of the high percentage of home owership (74 percent) and relatively small population (less than 40,000)."
